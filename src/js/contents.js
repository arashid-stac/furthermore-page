                    In case you skipped passed the About section in the previous page allow me to reintroduce myself.
                    Greetings, my name is Alli and on this page I will be summarizing my highs, lows, trials, tribulations,
                    and overall thoughts and emotions on what has gotten me this far and has made me who I am today.
                </p>

                <p className="title">Origin.</p>
                <p>
                    My story begins on the 7th of June in the year 1997. I was born and raised in the beautiful port city
                    of Greece known as Piraeus. Oh the days of old. My childhood consisted of mostly prepubescent
                    bicycle-adventures, cartoons, and card games. As an elementary and high school student I was never
                    one to think of education as an essential aspect in one’s life. Regardless of how I viewed academia,
                    I still somehow always found myself performing to the best of my abilities albeit not having any goal
                    in mind. To my young self I just thought it to be natural to strive hard regardless of any output.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Eventually I found myself graduating top of my class with a dilemma at hand. With no particular motive
                    in mind, my hard-working but naive self was presented with an enormous question: What next?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I looked around and it seemed to me that all my friends who were graduating with me knew exactly what
                    they were going to do next with their lives. They were all heading to further their education in their
                    particular fields of interest. But what about me? I had no interest in anything just because I had never
                    really thought about life after high school. I guess that’s what happens when you work hard while wearing
                    a blindfold.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The realization of being left behind led to my searching for an area of focus. In retrospect, forcing
                    myself to be interested in something was definitely a bad idea, although waiting until I naturally became
                    interested in it would have probably been more detrimental. After some research, a knowledgeable friend
                    named Google informed me that one of the most lucrative careers that were increasing in demand was Software
                    Engineering. That finding began my forced interest into Computer Science.
                </p>

                <p className="title">How I Ended Up Here.</p>
                <p>
                    After my decision to pursue computer science was made, I sought educational counselling from one of my
                    professors. Ultimately, the verdict was that for this particular field of interest, the best decision
                    would be to study in the United States. My professors thought it to be a good idea, my parents thought it
                    to be a good idea, and my friends thought it to be a good idea. Everyone around me signaled a green light,
                    and just like that I was off to the races. Without much solid research my 18 year old self blindly went
                    through with the plan without considering multiple factors, one of them being my girlfriend who had decided
                    to attend a University in Greece.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And so the preparations began. After taking the SAT test (twice because I wasn’t happy the first time,
                    although my second time ended up being a flop, too lol..), acquiring my student visa, and saying my
                    emotional goodbyes, I was on my way to St. Thomas Aquinas College in Sparkill, New York.

                <p className="title">Realizing What I Had Gotten Myself Into.</p>
                <p>
                    Adjusting to life in America was not as hard as I thought it’d be since there was no language barrier
                    (growing up I spoke English more than Greek, long story). My first year in college flew by and although
                    I was academically excelling, I knew inside me that I was far from grasping the study of Computer Science,
                    and, more specifically, the art of coding. My second year in college came around, and I still had no idea
                    as to what any bit of coding meant regardless of my continuous excellent grades. I was told by an upperclassman
                    that everybody starts out this way and that eventually they understand what their doing. But even so, my lack
                    of understanding was still personally worrisome.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is when doubt began to creep in. Had I made the wrong choice? Sure my grades so far had been impeccable,
                    but surely my lack of understanding would hinder my ability to make something of myself once the curtains for
                    academia were closed. Three years in and I had started facing the fact that maybe my chosen career path was one
                    I just would never be able to understand without a passion for it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had given up until I noticed that one of my fellow computer science classmates began to drastically improve
                    in the field and get a better grasp of what it means to be a Computer Scientist. The secret to solving my dilemma
                    was available to me all along. The trick to becoming a better programmer was to actually engage in projects and
                    create my own outside of just school-assigned tasks. This was completely news to me as someone who all his life
                    had just followed the rule books with a blindfold on.
                </p>

                <p className="title">Present.</p>
                <p>
                    Here I am now preparing to enter my senior year in college and feeling better about my skills as a programmer
                    as ever. Every single day I find myself more immersed into different types of technologies, and, as a result,
                    I have improved my knowledge and capabilities as a Computer Scientist. I used to walk the path because it seemed
                    interesting. Now I walk the path because I myself am interested.</p>

                <p className="title">Where Do I Go From Here.</p>
                <p>
                    Although the path to perfecting my craft is far from over, I am in no rush to reach the conclusion.
                    Thank you for taking the time to read my story, and I hope that my journey has somehow benefited you
                    in your walk.
