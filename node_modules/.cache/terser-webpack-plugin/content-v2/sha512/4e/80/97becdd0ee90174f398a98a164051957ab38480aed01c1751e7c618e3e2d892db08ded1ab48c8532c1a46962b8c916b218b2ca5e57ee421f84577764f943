1997. I was born and raised in the beautiful port city\\r\\n                    of Greece known as Piraeus. Oh the days of old. My childhood consisted of mostly prepubescent\\r\\n                    bicycle-adventures, cartoons, and card games. As an elementary and high school student I was never\\r\\n                    one to think of education as an essential aspect in one’s life. Regardless of how I viewed academia,\\r\\n                    I still somehow always found myself performing to the best of my abilities albeit not having any goal\\r\\n                    in mind. To my young self I just thought it to be natural to strive hard regardless of any output.\\r\\n                </p>\\r\\n                <p>\\r\\n                    Eventually I found myself graduating top of my class with a dilemma at hand. With no particular motive\\r\\n                    in mind, my hard-working but naive self was presented with an enormous question: What next?\\r\\n                </p>\\r\\n                <p>\\r\\n                    I looked around and it seemed to me that all my friends who were graduating with me knew exactly what\\r\\n                    they were going to do next with their lives. They were all heading to further their education in their\\r\\n                    particular fields of interest. But what about me? I had no interest in anything just because I had never\\r\\n                    really thought about life after high school. I guess that’s what happens when you work hard while wearing\\r\\n                    a blindfold.\\r\\n                </p>\\r\\n                <p>\\r\\n                    The realization of being left behind led to my searching for an area of focus. In retrospect, forcing\\r\\n                    myself to be interested in something was definitely a bad idea, although waiting until I naturally became\\r\\n                    interested in it would have probably been more detrimental. After some research, a knowledgeable friend\\r\\n                    named Google informed me that one of the most lucrative careers that were increasing in demand was Software\\r\\n                    Engineering. That finding began my forced interest into Computer Science.\\r\\n                </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n                <p className=\\\"title\\\">How I Ended Up Here.</p>\\r\\n                <p>\\r\\n                    After my decision to pursue computer science was made, I sought educational counselling from one of my\\r\\n                    professors. Ultimately, the verdict was that for this particular field of interest, the best decision\\r\\n                    would be to study in the United States. My professors thought it to be a good idea, my parents thought it\\r\\n                    to be a good idea, and my friends thought it to be a good idea. Everyone around me signaled a green light,\\r\\n                    and just like that I was off to the races. Without much solid research my 18 year old self blindly went\\r\\n                    through with the plan without considering multiple factors, one of them being my girlfriend who had decided\\r\\n                    to attend a University in Greece.\\r\\n                </p>\\r\\n                <p>\\r\\n                    And so the preparations began. After taking the SAT test (twice because I wasn’t happy the first time,\\r\\n                    although my second time ended up being a flop, too lol..), acquiring my student visa, and saying my\\r\\n                    emotional goodbyes, I was on my way to St. Thomas Aquinas College in Sparkill, New York.\\r\\n                </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n                <p className=\\\"title\\\">Realizing What I Had Gotten Myself Into.</p>\\r\\n                <p>\\r\\n                    Adjusting to life in America was not as hard as I thought it’d be since there was no language barrier\\r\\n                    (growing up I spoke English more than Greek, long story). My first year in college flew by and although\\r\\n                    I was academically excelling, I knew inside me that I was far from grasping the study of Computer Science,\\r\\n                    and, more specifically, the art of coding. My second year in college came around, and I still had no idea\\r\\n                    as to what any bit of coding meant regardless of my continuous excellent grades. I was told by an upperclassman\\r\\n                    that everybody starts out this way and that eventually they understand what their doing. But even so, my lack\\r\\n                    of understanding was still personally worrisome.\\r\\n                </p>\\r\\n                <p>\\r\\n                    This is when doubt began to creep in. Had I made the wrong choice? Sure my grades so far had been impeccable,\\r\\n                    but surely my lack of understanding would hinder my ability to make something of myself once the curtains for\\r\\n                    academia were closed. Three years in and I had started facing the fact that maybe my chosen career path was one\\r\\n                    I just would never be able to understand without a passion for it.\\r\\n                </p>\\r\\n                <p>\\r\\n                    I had given up until I noticed that one of my fellow computer science classmates began to drastically improve\\r\\n                    in the field and get a better grasp of what it means to be a Computer Scientist. The secret to solving my dilemma\\r\\n                    was available to me all along. The trick to becoming a better programmer was to actually engage in projects and\\r\\n                    create my own outside of just school-assigned tasks. This was completely news to me as someone who all his life\\r\\n                    had just followed the rule books with a blindfold on.\\r\\n                </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n                <p className=\\\"title\\\">Present.</p>\\r\\n                <p>\\r\\n                    Here I am now preparing to enter my senior year in college and feeling better about my skills as a programmer\\r\\n                    as ever. Every single day I find myself more immersed into different types of technologies, and, as a result,\\r\\n                    I have improved my knowledge and capabilities as a Computer Scientist.
