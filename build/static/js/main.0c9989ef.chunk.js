I was born and raised in the beautiful port city of Greece known as Piraeus. Oh the days of old. My childhood consisted of mostly prepubescent bicycle-adventures, cartoons, and card games. As an elementary and high school student I was never one to think of education as an essential aspect in one\u2019s life. Regardless of how I viewed academia, I still somehow always found myself performing to the best of my abilities albeit not having any goal in mind. To my young self I just thought it to be natural to strive hard regardless of any output."),i.a.createElement("p",null,"Eventually I found myself graduating top of my class with a dilemma at hand.

In retrospect, forcing myself to be interested in something was definitely a bad idea, although waiting until I naturally became interested in it would have probably been more detrimental.

Everyone around me signaled a green light, and just like that I was off to the races.

My second year in college came around, and I still had no idea as to what any bit of coding meant regardless of my continuous excellent grades.
